    "description": "Spot is a rescue but super sweet and a cuddle bug. She's quiet and well-behaved but can't be around other dogs, though will warm up to you after inital nervousness wears off. She requires 10-15 minute walks 4 times a day every 3-5 hours (unless sleeping). She is reactive on leash around other dogs so avoid busy streets and dogs on walks.",
